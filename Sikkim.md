<h1>SIKKIM</h1>
<h2>State</h2>
<p>
   Sikkim is a state in northeastern India. It borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China in the north and northeast, Bhutan in the east, Nepal 
   in the west, and West Bengal in the south. Sikkim is also close to India's Siliguri Corridor near Bangladesh. Sikkim is the least populous and 
   second smallest among the Indian states. A part of the Eastern Himalaya, Sikkim is notable for its biodiversity, including alpine and 
   subtropical climates, as well as being a host to Kangchenjunga, the highest peak in India and third highest on Earth.Sikkim's capital and 
   largest city is Gangtok. Almost 35% of the state is covered by the Khangchendzonga National Park - a UNESCO World Heritage Site.<br>

   The Kingdom of Sikkim was founded by the Namgyal dynasty in the 17th century. It was ruled by Buddhist priest-kings known as the Chogyal.
   It became a princely state of British India in 1890. Following Indian independence, Sikkim continued its protectorate status with the Union of 
   India after 1947, and the Republic of India after 1950. It enjoyed the highest literacy rate and per capita income among Himalayan states.
   In 1973, anti-royalist riots took place in front of the Chogyal's palace. In 1975, after the Indian Army took over the city of Gangtok, a 
   referendum was held that led to the deposition of the monarchy and Sikkim joining India as its 22nd state.<br>

   Modern Sikkim is a multiethnic and multilingual Indian state. The official languages of the state are English, Nepali, Sikkimese and Lepcha.
   Additional official languages include Gurung, Limbu, Magar, Mukhia, Newari, Rai, Sherpa and Tamang for the purpose of preservation of culture 
   and tradition in the state.English is taught in schools and used in government documents. The predominant religions are Hinduism and Vajrayana 
   Buddhism. Sikkim's economy is largely dependent on agriculture and tourism. As of 2014, the state had the third-smallest GDP among Indian states,
    although it is also among the fastest-growing.<br>

    Sikkim accounts for the largest share of cardamom production in India, and is the world's second largest producer of the spice after 
    Guatemala. Sikkim achieved its ambition to convert its agriculture to fully organic between 2003 and 2016, and became the first state in India
     to achieve this distinction.It is also among India's most environmentally conscious states, having banned plastic water bottles 
     "in any government functions and meetings" and polystyrene products (throughout the state).<br>
<h2>Culture</h2>

    Bhimsen Puja, are popular.Losar, Saga Dawa, Lhabab Duechen, Drupka Teshi and Bhumchu are among the Buddhist festivals celebrated in Sikkim. During 
    the Losar (Tibetan New Year), most offices and educational institutions are closed for a week.<br>

    Western rock music and Indian pop have gained a wide following in Sikkim. Nepali rock and Lepcha music are also popular.Sikkim's most popular 
    sports are football and cricket, although hang gliding and river rafting have grown popular as part of the tourism industry.<br>
</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>
    The Lepchas are considered to be the earliest inhabitants of Sikkim.However the Limbus and the Magars also lived in the inaccessible parts of West 
    and South districts as early as the Lepchas perhaps lived in the East and North districts.The Buddhist saint Padmasambhava, also known as 
    Guru Rinpoche, is said to have passed through the land in the 8th century.The Guru is reported to have blessed the land, introduced Buddhism, 
    and foretold the era of monarchy that would arrive in Sikkim centuries later.
</p>
<h3>Foundation of the Monarchy</h3>
<p>
    According to legend, Khye Bumsa, a 14th-century prince from the Minyak House in Kham in eastern Tibet, received a divine revelation instructing 
    him to travel south to seek his fortunes. A fifth-generation descendant of Khye Bumsa, Phuntsog Namgyal, became the founder of Sikkim's monarchy 
    in 1642, when he was consecrated as the first Chogyal, or priest-king, of Sikkim by the three venerated lamas at Yuksom.Phuntsog Namgyal was 
    succeeded in 1670 by his son, Tensung Namgyal, who moved the capital from Yuksom to Rabdentse (near modern Pelling). In 1700, Sikkim was invaded 
    by the Bhutanese with the help of the half-sister of the Chogyal, who had been denied the throne. The Bhutanese were driven away by the Tibetans, 
    who restored the throne to the Chogyal ten years later. Between 1717 and 1733, the kingdom faced many raids by the Nepalese in the west and 
    Bhutanese in the east, culminating with the destruction of the capital Rabdentse by the Nepalese.In 1791, China sent troops to support 
    Sikkim and defend Tibet against the Gorkha Kingdom. Following the subsequent defeat of Gorkha, the Chinese Qing dynasty established control 
    over Sikkim.

<h3>During the British Raj</h3>

    Following the beginning of British rule in neighbouring India, Sikkim allied with Britain against their common adversary, Nepal. The Nepalese 
    attacked Sikkim, overrunning most of the region including the Terai. This prompted the British East India Company to attack Nepal, resulting in the 
    Gurkha War of 1814.Treaties signed between Sikkim and Nepal resulted in the return of the territory annexed by the Nepalese in 1817. However, 
    ties between Sikkim and the British weakened when the latter began taxation of the Morang region. In 1849, two British physicians, 
    Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker and Dr. Archibald Campbell, the latter being in charge of relations between the British and Sikkimese governments, 
    ventured into the mountains of Sikkim unannounced and unauthorised.The doctors were detained by the Sikkimese government, 
    leading to a punitive British expedition against the kingdom, after which the Darjeeling district and Morang were annexed to British India 
    in 1853.<br>
    The Chogyal of Sikkim became a titular ruler under the directive of the British governor as a result of the invasion.<br>

    Sikkim became a British protectorate in the later decades of the 19th century, formalised by a convention signed with China in 1890.
</p>
<h3>Indian protectorate</h3>
<p>
    Prior to Indian independence, Jawaharlal Nehru, as the Vice President of the Executive Council, pushed through a resolution in the 
    Indian Constituent Assembly to the effect that Sikkim and Bhutan, as Himalayan states, <br>were not 'Indian states' and their future should be 
    negotiated separately.A standstill agreement was signed in February 1948.<br>
    Meanwhile, Indian independence and its move to democracy spurred a fledgling political movement in Sikkim, giving rise to the formation of 
    Sikkim State Congress (SSC), a pro-accession political party. The party sent a plate of demands to the palace, including a demand for accession 
    to India. The palace attempted to defuse the movement by appointing three secretaries from the SSC to the government and sponsoring a 
    counter-movement in the name of Sikkim National Party, which opposed accession to India.<br>
    The demand for responsible government continued and the SSC launched a civil disobedience movement. The Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal asked 
    India for help in quelling the movement, which was offered in the form of a small military police force and an Indian Dewan. In 1950, 
    a treaty was agreed between India and Sikkim which gave Sikkim the status of an Indian protectorate. Sikkim came under the suzerainty of India,
    which controlled its external affairs, defence, diplomacy and communications.In other respects, Sikkim retained administrative autonomy.<br>
    A state council was established in 1953 to allow for constitutional government under the Chogyal. Despite pressures from an India 
    "bent on annexation", Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal was able to preserve autonomy and shape a "model Asian state" where the literacy 
    rate and per capita income were twice as high as neighbouring Nepal, Bhutan and India.Meanwhile, the Sikkim National Congress demanded fresh 
    elections and greater representation for Nepalis in Sikkim. People marched on the palace against the monarchy. In 1973, 
    anti-royalist riots took place in front of the Chogyal's palace.
</p>
<h3>Annexation and statehood</h3>
<p>
    In 1975, the Prime Minister of Sikkim appealed to the Indian Parliament for Sikkim to become a state of India. In April of that year, 
    the Indian Army took over the city of Gangtok and disarmed the Chogyal's palace guards. <br>Thereafter, a referendum was held in which 97.5% 
    of voters r centsupported abolishing the monarchy, effectively approving union with India. India is said to have stationed 20,000–40,000 troops 
    in a country of only 200,000 during the referendum.On 16 May 1975, Sikkim became the 22nd state of the Indian Union, and the monarchy was 
    abolished.To enable the incorporation of the new state, the Indian Parliament amended the Indian Constitution. First, the 35th Amendment laid 
    down a set of conditions that made Sikkim an "Associate State", a special designation not used by any other state. A month later, the 36th 
    Amendment repealed the 35th Amendment, and made Sikkim a full state, adding its name to the First Schedule of the Constitution.

<h3>Recent history</h3>
<p>
    In 2000, the seventeenth Karmapa, Urgyen Trinley Dorje, who had been confirmed by the Dalai Lama and accepted as a tulku by the Chinese 
    government, escaped from Tibet, seeking to return to the Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim. Chinese officials were in a quandary on this issue, 
    as any protests to India would mean an explicit endorsement of India's governance of Sikkim, which China still recognised as an independent 
    state occupied by India. The Chinese government eventually recognised Sikkim as an Indian state in 2003, on the condition that 
    India officially recognise Tibet as a part of China; New Delhi had originally accepted Tibet as a part of China in 1953 during the 
    government of Jawaharlal Nehru. The 2003 agreement led to a thaw in Sino-Indian relations, and on 6 July 2006, the Sikkimese Himalayan pass 
    of Nathu La was opened to cross-border trade, becoming the first open border between India and China.The pass, which had previously been 
    closed since the 1962 Sino-Indian War, was an offshoot of the ancient Silk Road.<br>

    On 18 September 2011, a magnitude 6.9Mw earthquake struck Sikkim, killing at least 116 people in the state and in Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh 
    and Tibet.More than 60 people died in Sikkim alone, and the city of Gangtok suffered significant damage.<br>
